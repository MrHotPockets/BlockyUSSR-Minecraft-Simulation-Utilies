First it sets the incrementing expression "i" to 0, then it uses a while loop that
checks if storename, the name of the list that is being called, matches window.storedlist[i], 
which is a name of a list stored in the list database "window.storedlist". If not,
it will increment variable "i" by 2, and check if "i" is greater than the length
of the list database, which will execute a console log saying "The list
you put in is not stored", and return an empty string if so. If storename does 
match "window.storedlist[i]", it will return "window.storedlist[i + 1]", which
is the list of the list being called. The reason why a "+ 1" is added is because
lists are stored with the name first and then the list itself.
